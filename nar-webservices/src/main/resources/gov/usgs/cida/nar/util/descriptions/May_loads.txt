#SITE_QW_ID USGS station identifier for water-quality sampling
#SITE_FLOW_ID USGS or other agency station identifier for streamflow measurement
#"CONSTIT Abbreviation indicating constituent type.  Values include NO23, nitrate plus nitrite as N; TN, total nitrogen as N; TP, total phosphorus as P; SSC, suspended-sediment concentration"
#WY Water year (10/1 through 9/30)

#"MODTYPE The type of model used to compute load values.  Values include COMP, indicating the composite method; CONTIN, indicating loads were computed through the use of continuous nitrate data; DAILY, indicated data were computed using daily values (SSC only); REG, indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website using a 5-year moving window; REG_2, REG_3, REG_4, indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website but with a 2, 3, or 4-year moving windows (respectively) as opposed to a 5-year moving window; REG_PRELIM, indicating that a model was developed using data collecting during the initial 2-4 years in which a site was sampled, models at these sites will continue to be updated until 5 years of data are collected"
#"TONS Load, in tons"
#"TONS_L95 Lower 95% confidence interval of the load, in tons"
#"TONS_U95 Upper 95% confidence interval of the load, in tons"
