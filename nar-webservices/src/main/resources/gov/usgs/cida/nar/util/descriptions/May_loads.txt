#SITE_QW_ID USGS station identifier for water-quality sampling
#SITE_FLOW_ID USGS or other agency station identifier for streamflow measurement
#"CONSTIT Abbreviation indicating constituent type.  Values include NO23, nitrate plus nitrite as N; TN, total nitrogen as N; TP, total phosphorus as P; SSC, suspended-sediment concentration"
#WY Water year (10/1 through 9/30)

#"MODTYPE The type of model used to compute load values.  Values include “COMP”, indicating the composite method; “CONTIN”, indicating loads were computed through the use of continuous nitrate data; “DAILY”, indicated data were computed using daily values (SSC only); REG, indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website using a 5-year moving window; “REG_2, REG_3, REG_4”, indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website but with a 2, 3, or 4-year moving windows (respectively) as opposed to a 5-year moving window; “REG_PRELIM”, indicating that a model was developed using data collecting during the initial 2-4 years in which a site was sampled, models at these sites will continue to be updated until 5 years of data are collected"
